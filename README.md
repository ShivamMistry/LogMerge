#LogMerge

LogMerge is a simple program used for merging together IRC logs produced by the
XChat IRC client.

This is useful if you have more than one computer and your logs are scattered around them.

It has no dependencies other than Java (version 7 at least).

###Preparation

Put each log folder into the same directory.

###Usage

Once compiled, you can start LogMerge by using

    java com.speed.merge.LogMerge /dir/containing/logs/in/separate/dirs
